...dcc framework for Warhorse to checkout

Please find in this repo:

3 folders

1. "cctfw_project_shared" - added to site-packages for both this and an unenclosed unreal framework that i recently started. 
2. "DCCTFW" - DCC framework. Is currently configured for Maya 2025...so python 3.8 and pyside6
3. "maya_set_up" - Do this at your own risk. I have only test on my PC and you need to change env vars and install some stuff

all work was done by me, beside what i stole from stackoverflow, in PyCharm 2021.3.2 (Community Edition)
